![image1](Images/image1.png)

Description:

In this exercise, participants will upload the exported Process Hierarchy from SAP Solution Manager into SAP Cloud ALM. This ensures that the business process structure from the source system becomes available in SAP Cloud ALM as part of the Selective Data Transfer (SDT).

Objective:

Build understanding of how the Process Hierarchy export from SAP Solution Manager is uploaded into SAP Cloud ALM, how validation works, and how relationships to other entities (e.g., libraries, executables) are established during the import process.
